## What is Pico 8

The Pico-8 is a virtual machine and game engine created by Lexaloffle Games. It is designed to mimic a fantasy video game console, by emulating the harsh hardware limitations of the video game consoles around the 1980s. The harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work with, to encourage small but expressive designs, and to give cartridges made with PICO-8 their own particular look and feel. The coding is accomplished through a Lua-based environment, in which users can create music, sound effects, sprites, maps, and games.
